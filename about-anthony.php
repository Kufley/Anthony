          <p>My vast experiences attained as a Registered Dietitian, Nutrition Therapist and Behavior Therapist have come about as a result of working at: </p>
          <ul >
            <li>Colleges, universities and hospitals</li>
            <li>Medical doctor's offices</li>
            <li>A nationally recognized health coaching company</li>
            <li>Working privately with individuals for weight management, eating
              disorders, bariatric surgery, sports performance & medical nutrition therapy (ie: diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, heart disease, kidney disease, etc).</li>
          </ul>
          <p> The experience and knowledge I have gained over the years have enabled me to assist individuals with accomplishing their weight loss and wellness goals.</p>
          <p>My educational background in both Nutrition and Behavioral Psychology have given me tremendous insight into helping individuals identify and then eliminate the true causes of their weight loss struggles. </p>
          <p>I have learned that unless individuals identify what their obstacles are, as well as why they exist, creating a successful weight loss plan becomes very difficult if not impossible.</p>

          <p>Throughout high school I was always very thin and had the luxury of eating anything I wanted and as much of it as I liked without ever having to be concerned with gaining weight.</p>
          <p>However, when I started Cornell University about 10 years later, that wasn&rsquo;t the situation anymore. In the following years at Cornell I started to struggle with keeping my waistline in check. </p>
          <p>Before I knew it my pants size had gone from a 31 to a 36 and my midsection was unsightly to say the least. I never thought the day would come when I would be hording belly fat, but the day had finally arrived. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="meetanthony_right size_67">
        <div class="executiveweight_text">
          <p>My increase in belly fat was occurring for numerous reasons. As a college student at Cornell I often felt very stressed and for myself like many others who are stressed, my instinct was to eat foods that tasted good and that would take me out of this negative, stressed state of mind and move me into a more positive and relaxed one. </p>
          <p>So to accomplish this when I was stressed I would often eat sugary, fatty, high calorie, high glycemic index foods to make myself feel better. And to some extent, it worked. Unfortunately, I continued with this behavior and continued to struggle with my waist size. Simply, I had become an &quot;emotional eater&quot;.</p>
          <p>In addition to being an emotional eater, while a college student I often found myself short on time in which case I would regularly skip meals. But soon after, I would become ravenously hungry and try to find a vending machine or head over to the campus bookstore to get some ready&ndash;to&ndash;eat foods. </p>
          <p> Because I was so hungry and didn't feel mentally sharp as a result, I would make poor food choices and then over-indulge on the sugary, fatty foods that I had just purchased. This served to compound my problem with my waistline.</p>
          <p>&quot;Interestingly enough, one of the best things about being a student at Cornell is the food! Being on the meal plan as I was, I had daily access to a smorgasbord of just about every type of food you could imagine, including desserts.</p>
          <p> I could eat as many cheeseburgers and fried onion rings as I wanted to every night, and follow it with freshly baked delicious cakes and cookies. And I often did! Again, this just added more fat to my already growing belly.&quot;</p>
          <p> And to add insult to injury, if eating poorly due to feeling excessively stressed and running short on time weren&rsquo;t bad enough, I&rsquo;m someone who has always had a &quot;sweet&ndash;tooth&quot;.</p>

          <p>My issues with belly fat for years was in large part due to emotional eating, eating poorly due to a lack of time and energy, having too much access to high calorie foods, and letting my &lsquo;sweet-tooth&rsquo; get the best of me. </p>
          <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I became a Registered Dietitian and started getting hands-on experience with overweight and eating disorders individuals that I started to change my behaviors. </p>
          <p>After I created my own &quot;recipe-for-success&quot;, I soon started making more intelligent food choices, watched my belly fat disappear, and went back to my normal pants size.</p>

          <p>When not working with clients, I really enjoy working out at the gym with weights and the spinning bike, as well as spending time at home with my German Shepherd. </p>
          <p>When it comes to food, eating is one of my favorite activities &ndash; I LOVE to eat! Italian food is my favorite type of cuisine, eggplant parmigiana and lasagna are two of my favorite foods, while yogurt with fresh fruit is my favorite snack. </p>
          <p>I truly believe that any food can be part of a healthy diet!</p>
