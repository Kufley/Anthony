                        <p> My name is Anthony Wilson and I'm a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RD/RDN) and Behavior
                            Therapist. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nutrition from Cornell University, a Master's
                            Degree in Behavioral & Sport Psychology from Ithaca College, and completed a mandatory
                            1-year Dietetic Internship through Oakwood University and Cayuga Medical Center.</p>
                        <p> My
                            experience includes working at hospitals, colleges, universities, eating disorders clinic, a
                            nationally recognized health coaching company, and private practice. Some areas of nutrition
                            I've worked in include weight management, eating disorders, bariatric surgery, sports
                            performance and medical nutrition therapy such as diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, heart
                            disease, kidney disease and more. </p>
                        <p> Even with all
                            of my education and experience, why should <span class="underline">you</span> care about
                            what I have to say? Because before
                            becoming a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, for <span class="underline">YEARS</span> I
                            seriously struggled to keep my belly
                            fat and weight in check. Therefore, I think it's fair to say...</p>

                        <li>I gained weight when I ate the smallest number of meals per day.</li>
                        <li>I gained weight during the weeks and months when my caloric intake was at its lowest
                            followed by my usual caloric intake.
                        </li>
                        <li>I gained weight when I ate the greatest number of calories per week – no surprise there.</li>
                        <li class="bottom-20">I gained vast amounts of belly fat when I consumed sugary liquids which
                            were high in 'high
                            fructose corn syrup' (ie: soda)
                            even when I didn't go over my daily caloric intake.
                        </li>
                        <li>I didn't gain any weight when I ate most of my calories at night, as surprising as that may
                            seem to many people.
                        </li>
                        <li>I didn't gain any weight when I ate numerous foods on a regular basis that were high in
                            sugar,
                            so long as it was not high fructose corn syrup sugar, as surprising as that may seem to many
                            people.
                        </li>
                        <li >So long as I didn't go over my caloric limit for the day, I didn't gain

                            what
                            type of foods I ate EXCEPT for high fructose corn syrup.
                        </li>
                        <li class="bottom-20">I didn't need to go on a "special diet" to get back to my usual (healthy) weight after
                            having gained a lot of belly fat and weight.
                        </li>
                        <li>Losing the last 10-15 pounds were the most difficult pounds to lose - no surprise there.
                        </li>
                        <li>I would never undergo bariatric surgery because it largely takes away one of life's greatest
                            pleasures - eating!
                        </li>

                            check than living
                            with six-pack abs or just a lean physique !

                        <li>Skipping meals was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made with my weight – it led to
                            numerous problems.
                        </li>
                        <li>When I increased the total number of meals/snacks per day, <span

                            day, I lost weight more easily.
                        </li>
                        <li>When I ate more foods with natural sugar, like fruit, I lost
                            most of my desire for foods with artificial sugar, like candy.
                        </li>
                        <li class="bottom-20">Writing my food intake in a food
                            log each day was one of the most important things I did to lose my belly fat and
                            maintain
                            my weight.
                        </li>
                        <li>Drinking good tasting water with zero calories instead of drinking caloric beverages
                            like juice or soda was one of the best and smartest things I did to decrease my caloric
                            consumption.
                        </li>
                        <li>I learned how to cook simple, fast meals and now I love to cook!</li>
                        <li>My overall confidence level went down when I had a lot of belly fat and it went to its
                            highest when I had
                            six-pack abs!
                        </li>
                        <li class="bottom-20">Depression makes getting and staying motivated much, much harder to do; I
                            didn't
                            lose any weight during this time because I didn't eat enough meals and my metabolism
                            plummeted.

                        <li>Success at the <span class="underline">beginning</span> of my weight loss journey was
                            <span class="underline">critical</span> for my long-term success; it got
                            me really motivated to keepgoing and feel like I could reach my exact goal!

                        <li>An excellent
                            support system, a healthy environment, planning ahead, accurate nutrition information
                            and
                            staying motivated are keys to success!
                        </li>
                        <li class="bottom-20">Unless you identify what your obstacles are, as well as
                            why they exist, creating a successful weight loss plan becomes very difficult, if not
                            impossible.
                        </li>
                        <li>I was an emotional eater and ate to take myself out of a stressed, negative state of mind
                            and put myself into a more relaxed, positive state of mind, and gained a lot of belly fat in
                            the process!
                        </li>
                        <li>When you are ravenously hungry you tend to make very poor food choices, such as
                            choosing high-sugar, high-fat, high-calorie foods, as well as over-indulging on them.
                        </li>
                        <li class="bottom-20"> If you plan ahead with your meals and snacks and then find yourself short
                            on time, you'll
                            find that you can maintain your healthy eating without difficulty.
                        </li>
                        <li>I have a sweet-tooth and I satisfy it when I need to without ever gaining any belly fat or
                            weight!
                        </li>
                        <li>Individuals who are overweight and individuals with eating disorders who are very thin have
                            a lot in common.
                        </li>
