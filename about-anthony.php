                        <p> My name is Anthony Wilson and I'm a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RD/RDN) and Behavior
                            Therapist. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nutrition from Cornell University, a Master's
                            Degree in Behavioral & Sport Psychology from Ithaca College, and completed a mandatory
                            1-year Dietetic Internship through Oakwood University and Cayuga Medical Center.</p>
                        <p> My
                            experience includes working at hospitals, colleges, universities, eating disorders clinic, a
                            nationally recognized health coaching company, and private practice. Some areas of nutrition
                            I've worked in include weight management, eating disorders, bariatric surgery, sports
                            performance and medical nutrition therapy such as diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, heart
                            disease, kidney disease and more. </p>
                        <p> Even with all
                            of my education and experience, why should <span class="underline">you</span> care about
                            what I have to say? Because before
                            becoming a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, for <span class="underline">YEARS</span> I
                            seriously struggled to keep my belly
                            fat and weight in check. Therefore, I think it's fair to say...</p>

                            <li>I gained vast amounts of belly fat when I consumed sugary liquids which were high in "high-fructose corn syrup" (ie: soda) even when I didn't go over my daily caloric intake.
                            </li>
                            <li>I didn't gain any weight or belly fat when I ate most of my calories at night, so long as I didn't go over my caloric limit for the day.

                            <li>I didn't need to go on a "special diet" to get back to my usual (healthy) weight after having gained a lot of belly fat and weight previously.

                            <li>Writing my daily food intake in a food log each day was one of the most important things I did to lose my belly fat and then maintain my weight.
                            </li>
                            <li>Drinking good tasting water with zero calories instead of drinking caloric beverages like juice or soda was one of the best and smartest things I did to decrease my caloric consumption.

                            <li>Success at the <span class="underline">beginning</span> of my weight loss journey was <span class="underline">critical</span> for my long-term success; it got me really motivated to keep going and feel like I could reach my exact goals.
