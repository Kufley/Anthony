                      <div class="consultation_box_first_line">What will I achieve with the help of a registered dietitian, certified personal trainer, and behavior therapist?
                      
                      <p>By working with the guidance of an experienced Registered Dietitian, Certified Personal Trainer, and Behavior Therapist, you are putting yourself in the best position to be successful with your weight management goals. Anthony, a graduate of Cornell University, has been assisting individuals with achieving their desired body weight for close to 20 years. While working with Anthony, someone who takes a â€˜complete approachâ€™ to weight management, together you will create a â€œrecipe for successâ€? which incorporates the different elements that factor into being successful.</p>
                      
                      
                      <p>These would include such things as your current blood work, medical history, dietary intake, types and amounts of physical activity, habits and behaviors, food and nutrition knowledge, stress levels, goals, beliefs, and current obstacles and roadblocks that you need to overcome to be successful. With a dedicated effort, and subsequent weight loss, you will likely achieve a decreased risk of 
developing heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and numerous types of cancer, as well as your risk of common complications and illnesses from being overweight or obese such as bladder and bowel incontinence, insulin resistance, hypertension, sleep apnea, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome, impaired fertility, osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, gout, gall bladder disease, and respiratory problems will likely be significantly decreased. Additionally, you may experience a greater self-esteem and a more focused and productive work day.</p>
                      
                      <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">Whether it be due to feeling more comfortable in your clothing, to decreased stress levels, being able to participate in activities you didnâ€™t participate in before like athletic endeavors or social events, or just knowing that your odds of living a longer and more fulfilling life has increased, weight loss clients generally report feeling happier, having a more balanced life, and greater peace of mind. While on your weight loss journey, Anthony will show you unwavering dedication as you both work together to achieve your health and wellness goals!</p>

        <div class="consultation_box_first_line">Why should I choose executive weight loss coaching?
                      
                      <p>Executive Weight Loss Coaching is uniquely different for a number of reasons. Anthony Wilson, RD, CPT, MS, is probably the only Registered Dietitian in the country who is also a Certified Personal Trainer and Behavior Therapist. What is so beneficial about this is that nutrition, exercise, and 
behavior change are all highly interconnected areas and critical for weight management success.  Anthony has also worked as a sports dietitian helping athletes to eat optimally for their workouts and competition while trying to lose weight at the same time. This same sports nutrition is utilized with clients who are incorporating physical activity as part of their weight management plan.</p>
                      
                      
                      <p>One of the areas that Anthony specializes in, behavior change, is a central principle when it comes to your weight management plan and making important, positive changes such as eliminating behaviors that inhibit your ability to lose weight and reach your desired body weight. Anthonyâ€™s experience and knowledge with behavior therapy, as well as his ability to connect with people, facilitates him in getting clients to take the actions that lead them to achieving success with their weight 
management plan.</p>
                      
                      <p>One of the behaviors that many clients would like to change is how much they engage in physical activity. Even though weight management clients can lose a significant amount of weight without 
exercise, engaging in physical activity facilitates clients with reaching their desired weight faster. Given Anthonyâ€™s personal experience with bodybuilding and the training and knowledge he received while becoming a Certified Personal Trainer, he is in a position to facilitate individuals with building muscle, having more intense workouts, and burning more calories during as well as after exercise, all of which motivates clients to want to want to participate in more physical activity. </p>

<p style="padding-bottom:20px;">The bottom line is that Anthony will facilitate you in reaching your weight management goals by 
targeting the critical areas for success as he has done for so many happy and successful individuals! So please fill out the Free Consultation form and Executive Weight Loss Coaching will contact you to set up a day and time for your consultation. </p>

<div class="consultation_box_first_line" style="border-bottom:none;">How beneficial is phone and computer coaching?
                           

<p>Studies have shown that phone and computer coaching is at least as effective as in-person coaching. If you have ever been involved with any type of coaching over the phone you know that phone coaching is very efficient. Simply, there are fewer distractions that take up time so both client and coach 
generally get right to work at the start of the coaching session. Additionally, phone coaching is very convenient since you donâ€™t have to leave your office every time you have a session, which is a real time-saver. Anthony offers clients the choice of coaching over the phone or face-to-face coaching over the computer through the use of Skype. His first experience with phone and computer coaching was with the company Gordian Health Solutions in Franklin, TN. Immediately upon working with clients over the phone he noticed how focused and productive sessions were, and thus, how successful phone and computer coaching could be. His primary area with phone coaching was weight management and he regularly received excellent feedback from clients and supervisors and saw 
excellent results. Anthony estimates that he helped over 1,000 individuals work towards their weight management goals through this mode of coaching.</p>
