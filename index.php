                    very professional. He made me feel comfortable by taking things slowly and working at a pace that
                    I was comfortable with. I could see that he really cared about my condition and that he didn't want
                    to see me have long-term problems. After only working with Anthony for a short while, I trusted that
                    he had my best interests at heart. This really helped me to trust him which made it
                    easier to take his professional advice and make lasting changes with my lifestyle. You'll love
                    working with Anthony - he's very professional and humorous too!"</p>

                                            <p>I'm a diabetic who has been overweight most of my life and has suffered
                                                with bowel incontinence since becoming obese. From the first time I
                                                worked with Anthony he started educating me about nutrition & diabetes
                                                and I was amazed to learn that I held so many myths about nutrition in
                                                general. If I had not been educated by Anthony, I would still be going

                                                getting any better. Anthony really opened my eyes about the connections

                                            <p>Working with Anthony was a pleasure. I could tell he had been doing this
                                                for a long time. He looked at my situation and started making
                                                suggestions right away. Simply, I started doing what he said and it
                                                worked! I developed a new way of eating whereby I was not hungry, did
                                                not feel deprived, and started losing weight. As I've continued to do
                                                what he said, I continue to keep the weight off and feel very content
                                                with my new eating pattern. For the first time in years I feel like my
                                                chances of getting cancer are down and that my knees & back are finally
                                                on the mend. Thanks Anthony!</p>

                                            <p>Anthony was very professional. I was hesitant to get help with my
                                                condition because I didnâ€™t want someone criticizing my behaviors and
                                                telling me I should do this and that when I really didnâ€™t want to.
                                                Anthony focused our time and efforts on creating a mutually agreeable
                                                strategy whereby we put together nutrition and behavioral plans that
                                                kept me focused from the beginning of our time together. In the past I
                                                jumped from trying one idea to trying another without ever stayed
                                                focused. Anthony kept me very focused â€“ that was the ultimate key to my

                                                also really cared about me personally which inspired me to become the
                                                healthiest person I could be. When you feel that someone else really
                                                cares about you first and foremost, itâ€™s motivating. I wish I had met

                            <p>One of the top motivators that keeps individuals continuing with their weight loss
                                journey is SUCCESS! Simply, working with a professional greatly increases your chances
                                of success with your weight loss and this initial success will be critical for
                                maintaining motivation as you move forward with your weight loss journey.</p>
                            <p>Staying motivated because of your initial weight loss success can be powerful, however,
                                this is just one thing that will help keep you motivated. Often, in a working
                                relationship, (you and your dietitian, for example), your desire is to be successful
                                first and foremost for yourself, as it should be. But also, a part of your motivation to
                                be successful is because you don't want to disappoint the person assisting you and this
                                can be very motivating for you at times when you might otherwise falter.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, you know that the professional you are working with is going to hold you
                                accountable. This helps to keep you on your toes and be more inclined to do what's in
                                your best interests such as by following through with your game plan as best as
                                possible. And because of this you will be more successful, which again, fuels your
                                motivation over and over!</p>

                        <p>Not being aware of what your blood work reveals, and not knowing exactly what you need to do
                            to improve it can cost you in terms of weight loss. For instance, when your red blood cell
                            count, hemoglobin, or iron level is low, this can have a significant impact on your ability
                            to burn calories. Even though you probably had these tests run previously, they may not have
                            been tested in some time and the results now may be very different. Also, your doctor rarely
                            has time to go over your blood work in depth with you such as by discussing how and why your
                            blood work got low in the first place and exactly what you need to do to get those deficient
                            levels back to normal. Determining what caused these deficient levels is as important as
                            knowing how to get them to their proper levels. </p>
                        <p>One of the first things I do with clients is discuss the results of their recent or brand new
                            blood work. Together, we determine what caused your deficiencies and what must be done to
                            get them corrected. Then we apply it to your weight loss plan.</p>

                            don't come close to reaching their dream weight. This is due to numerous reasons, one of
                            which is, plain and simply, a lack of follow-through. This could be due to many reasons such
                            as a lack of factual information which inhibits success which leads to a loss of motivation
                            and ultimately, a lack of follow-through.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, they could have a fear of success or a fear of failure, both of which inhibit
                            follow-through. Also, their personal circumstances may be playing a large role and they are
                            not sure how to navigate through all of the different aspects of weight loss and eventually
                            abandon their weight loss journey.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the reason, follow-through is absolutely necessary for success! For many different

                        <p>Weight gain, instead of weight loss, due to "unintentional" yo-yo dieting occurs quite often.
                            Unfortunately, the end result is a higher body fat percentage and a slower metabolism.
                            "Unintentional yo-yo dieting" is the result of decreasing your caloric intake for a period
                            of time, such as 7-14 days, and then abruptly going back to eating the <i class="underline">same</i> number of
                            calories that you were eating <i class="underline">before</i> you started decreasing your caloric intake. The end
                            result is you lose vital muscle mass and gain fat mass.</p>
                        <p>In this case, you think you are eating the correct number of calories, but in actuality, you
                            are eating too many calories! Consequently, you gain fat mass and your weight goes up! When
                            you make that abrupt change, your metabolism is lower than it normally is and your body does
                            not require as many calories as you used to feed it just 1 - 2 weeks ago. The end result is
                            that you over-consume calories and gain fat mass, not muscle, and often have no idea
                            why!</p>

                        <p>Another top key to success when it comes to weight loss, and specifically, motivation, is
                            goal-setting. It is very motivating to make daily, short, and long-term goals and to make
                            them in a way that will benefit you the most. One way to do this is to make "SMART" goals.
                            "SMART" stands for Specific, Measurable, Adjustable, Realistic, and Timely. Many times
                            individuals go through the goal-setting process and do not go about it ideally, to say the
                            least. Subsequently, they find that their goal-setting did not accomplish one of the main
                            things it was meant to do: MOTIVATE!</p>
                        <p>Goal-setting that really motivates an individual helps to keep them focused and driven,
                            especially during difficult times. Therefore, goal-setting is critical for success!</p>

                        <p>Not having someone you trust to turn to for advice when you hit obstacles or are unsure about
                            which is the best way to proceed leads to, among other things, tremendous frustration.
                            Additionally, you then guess as to what to do and likely end up being even more frustrated
                            when things don't turn out as you had hoped they would. Therefore, one of the benefits of
                            working with a trusted professional is that you always have someone to turn to for expert
                            advice and guidance. Not only does this help you to be successful with your goals, but it
                            also helps you to experience much less frustration in the process!</p>

                        <h3 class="underline">SLOWER GAINS DUE TO THE BELIEF THAT YOU WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL: </h3>
                        <p>Many individuals trying to lose weight have tried to do so in the <span class="underline">past</span> and have failed.
                            Because of those former failures, these individuals have adopted the belief that they will
                            not be successful in the <span class="underline">future</span> with losing weight and maintaining that weight loss. Truly,
                            they want to lose weight, but don't believe it will ever become a reality. </p>
                        <p>In other words, they have a very restricting "limiting belief" in regards to their weight
                            loss desires. Ultimately, your limiting beliefs will affect your actions which will
                            definitely have a negative impact on how you move forward with your weight loss plan, as
                            well as whether or not you move forward with it at all. You need to identify your limiting
                            beliefs and then turn them into empowering beliefs! A professional with a behavioral
                            psychology background can help you do this. </p>

                        <h3 class="underline">SLOWER PROGRESS DUE TO DEFICIENT WEIGHT LOSS PRESCRIPTION: </h3>
                        <p>It's difficult for you to put together your best dietary "prescription" for your weight loss
                            journey without taking into account, among other things, your past and current medical
                            conditions and how they factor in. For instance, if you have had your gallbladder removed
                            you would need to know that you need to consume low fat meals for the rest of your life or
                            else you will have chronic diarrhea daily. </p>
                        <p>You might ask, "Even so, how does this factor into my weight loss?" If nothing else, having
                            diarrhea everyday will certainly affect which foods you can eat without having diarrhea
                            again, as well as it may play a role with you being able to exercise adequately due to your
                            hydration status, among other things.</p>
                        <p>Another example would be if you have diabetes. In this case you would need to know the most
                            successful ways to control and overcome your diabetes which would involve being aware of the
                            best ways to plan your meals, snacks, and exercise for the day and week. Therefore, it is
                            imperative to work with someone who understands not only "weight loss," but someone who is
                            also very knowledgeable about different medical conditions and what needs to be taken into
                            account when weight loss clients have different illnesses and diseases.</p>

                        <p>Knowing what to eat or drink before and after your workout, and exactly when to eat or drink
                            before and after your workout is critical if you are to get the most out of your workout in
                            terms of burning calories. Depending upon your workout goals, your nutrition prescription
                            will vary. For instance, is your goal to build muscle mass and increase your metabolism, or
                            is your goal to burn calories solely thourgh cardio work? This will have an impact on how
                            much of each nutrient you need to consume.</p>
                        <p>Many individuals base their pre- and post-workout meals and snacks on false information or no
                            information at all. Consequently, they do not consume the right foods at the right time
                            before and after workouts, and subsequently, do not get the most out of their workouts.
                            Simply, the poorer your nutrition workout plan is, the less energy you'll have for burning
                            calories during your workouts and the less muscle mass you will have, both of which will
                            lead you to burn less calories for the day!</p>

                          your calories</h3>
                        <p>Do you realize that you've been brainwashed and you don't even know it? Many people grew up being told that "there are many starving children in the world" and "you can't leave the table until you clean your plate."</p>
                        <p>You may have also been told that "wasting food means wasting money." For whatever reason, you have been conditioned to clean everything from your plate. But don't feel bad, you are not alone!</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="way-main">
                      <h3>Extra food</h3>
                      <p>I estimate that many people consume about 25% - 50% more food at mealtimes (especially dinner) than their bodies want or need. Why does</p>
                      <p>this happen? The main answer is that they are cleaning their plates after they have gotten signals from their brain that they are starting to get full, which is the point at which they should stop eating. However, many of us keep eating, even though it would be better to have stopped.</p>
                      <p>So how did that extra food get there in the first place? For starters, people have been conditioned, out of habit, to cover their entire plate with food. This process has been helped along by the fact that most of us make too much food to begin with. As a result, there is more food available to us, and when there is more food available to us, the bottom line is that we eat more of it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="way-main">
                      <h3>Easiest way to cut your amount</h3>
                      <p>The easiest way to cut down on the amount of food you take is to use a smaller plate. This way even if you fill your plate to capacity, you have less than you normally would because the size of your plate is smaller.</p>
                      <p>So for your next dinner meal, instead of using your typical dinner plates, use smaller plates, like lunch plates. You may need to go out and buy different sized plates, but it should be well worth the money!</p>
