        <div class="container">
            <article class="items">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">

                        <p>A few years back I knew someone whom I was genuinely fond of who was a very
                            intelligent, friendly and caring individual. However, they had been overweight
                            for decades and really needed to get to a healthy weight. Truly, I wanted to
                            work with this individual, but they kept putting off my assistance despite my
                            best efforts to convince them otherwise.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, after not seeing this individual for over a year I was absolutely
                            shocked to learn that they had died of a sudden heart attack. I was <em>extremely</em>
                            saddened to find this out. It was just another example of someone putting off
                            the help they needed until it was too late.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve seen many people struggle to lose weight and <em><u>keep it
                                    off</u></em>, and then go on to continue to live at a very unhealthy
                            weight because they didn&rsquo;t have the education and support they needed. I&#39;ve
                            heard the same people say year after year that they &ldquo;know&rdquo; what they
                            need to do, yet year after year, unfortunately, they never even come close to
                            reaching a healthy weight. Sooner or later they suffer the consequences, and it&#39;s
                            really very, very tragic because it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</p>

                        <p>That&#39;s why after more than a decade of education and after having worked
                            closely with more than 1,000 individuals for weight management, I came to the
                            conclusion that the best way that I could facilitate others who really
                            <em>want</em> and <em>need</em> to get healthy now was to offer my knowledge and
                            experience in the form of an ultimate weight management program. And that&#39;s
                            why I created the &ldquo;Dream Weight Silver Coaching Program&rdquo;.</p>

                                        <p>Working with Anthony was a pleasure. I could tell he had been doing this for
                                            a long time. He looked at my situation and started making suggestions right
                                            away. Simply, I started doing what he said and it worked! I developed a new
                                            way of eating whereby I was not hungry, did not feel deprived, and started
                                            losing weight. As I&#39;ve continued to do what he said, I continue to keep
                                            the weight off and feel very content with my new eating pattern. For the
                                            first time in years I feel like my chances of getting cancer are down and
                                            that my knees &amp; back are finally on the mend. Thanks Anthony!</p>

                                        <p>Anthony was very professional. I was hesitant to get help with my
                                            condition because I didn’t want someone criticizing my behaviors and
                                            telling me I should do this and that when I really didn’t want to.
                                            Anthony focused our time and efforts on creating a mutually agreeable
                                            strategy whereby we put together nutrition and behavioral plans that
                                            kept me focused from the beginning of our time together. In the past I
                                            jumped from trying one idea to trying another without ever stayed
                                            focused. Anthony kept me very focused – that was the ultimate key to my
                                            success!</p>

                                            with bowel incontinence since becoming obese. From the first time I worked
                                            with Anthony he started educating me about nutrition &amp; diabetes and I
                                            was amazed to learn that I held so many myths about nutrition in general. If

                                            path wondering why my conditions and weight weren&#39;t getting any better.
                                            Anthony really opened my eyes about the connections between nutrition,

                                        <p>Anthony really cares about you. I have worked with other clinicians in the past
                                            that seemed to just be going through the motions. Anthony was different. He was
                                            very knowledgeable like many other clinicians, but he also really cared about me
                                            personally which inspired me to become the healthiest person I could be. When
                                            you feel that someone else really cares about you first and foremost, it’s
                                            motivating. I wish I had met Anthony sooner.</p>

                                    <p>Working with Anthony was a pleasure. I could tell he had been doing this for
                                        a long time. He looked at my situation and started making suggestions right
                                        away. Simply, I started doing what he said and it worked! I developed a new
                                        way of eating whereby I was not hungry, did not feel deprived, and started
                                        losing weight. As I&#39;ve continued to do what he said, I continue to keep
                                        the weight off and feel very content with my new eating pattern. For the
                                        first time in years I feel like my chances of getting cancer are down and
                                        that my knees &amp; back are finally on the mend. Thanks Anthony!</p>

                                    <p>Anthony was very professional. I was hesitant to get help with my
                                        condition because I didn’t want someone criticizing my behaviors and
                                        telling me I should do this and that when I really didn’t want to.
                                        Anthony focused our time and efforts on creating a mutually agreeable
                                        strategy whereby we put together nutrition and behavioral plans that
                                        kept me focused from the beginning of our time together. In the past I
                                        jumped from trying one idea to trying another without ever stayed
                                        focused. Anthony kept me very focused – that was the ultimate key to my

                                    <p>I&#39;m a diabetic who has been overweight most of my life and has suffered
                                        with bowel incontinence since becoming obese. From the first time I worked
                                        with Anthony he started educating me about nutrition &amp; diabetes and I
                                        was amazed to learn that I held so many myths about nutrition in general. If
                                        I had not been educated by Anthony, I would still be going down the wrong
                                        path wondering why my conditions and weight weren&#39;t getting any better.
                                        Anthony really opened my eyes about the connections between nutrition,
                                        beating diabetes and living a healthier, more enjoyable life.</p>

                                        that seemed to just be going through the motions. Anthony was different. He was
                                        very knowledgeable like many other clinicians, but he also really cared about me
                                        personally which inspired me to become the healthiest person I could be. When
                                        you feel that someone else really cares about you first and foremost, it’s
                                        motivating. I wish I had met Anthony sooner.</p>
