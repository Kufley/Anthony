          <p> Marion was a former 35 year old weight loss client who was working at a college full-time.
            
            Simply, she was was not happy with her job and by the time she got home each day she was
            
            feeling somewhat depressed. Marion lived with her husband and 3 kids whom all enjoyed
            
            dinner together each night. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Marion was about 65# overweight and knew that she ate too much food at dinner time. She
            
            rationalized this by stating that her kids left food on their plates and that she "had to" consume
            
            their leftover food because she was not going to waste it. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> I suggested to her that she portion out her kid's food for them so that they didn' start dinner
            
            with more food on their plates than what they were capable of eating. She did this and soon
            
            her kids were not leaving food on their plates anymore. However, Marion soon noticed that she
            
            was still over-consuming at dinner time. After she got done eating what was on her plate, she
            
            went back for 2nds and 3rds. She then stated to me "dinner is the only thing I look forward to
            
            all day."? </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Upon realizing this, we got to the heart of Marion's problem. Marion was over-consuming
            
            food because she was somewhat depressed by dinner time, and by over-consuming at dinner
            
            time, she was attempting to take herself out of a negative state of mind and put herself into a
            
            positive state of mind. Simply, Marion was eating for emotional reasons. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Marion had self-esteem issues, symptoms of depression and anxiety, an unfriendly work
            
            environment, lacked motivation, lacked a strong support system outside of work, was in denial,
            
            and greatly needed someone to hold her accountable for her actions (and lack of actions). She
            
            also needed to find constructive ways to be happier on a daily basis. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Ironically, losing weight would have made that easier for her to achieve because of the
            
            opportunities it would have opened up for her. Additionally, because of all of the incorrect
            
            things she had heard and believed regarding diet and health, she needed education about
            
            nutrition. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> While working with Marion for 6 months we created a plan for her which facilitated her in
            
            many ways. Among other things, we determined what she could do on a daily basis to be in a
            
            more positive frame of mind all day. We created a support system that used to be obsolete, she
            
            changed jobs whereby her work environment was much more friendly and positive, and she
            
            started to involve herself with enjoyable activities every week, one of which was going to her
            
            local gym on a regular basis with her husband. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Marion no longer felt like her path to (temporary) happiness had to come from food at dinner
            
            time. She had changed her mindset to a positive one by changing numerous things in her life,
            
            and started reaping the benefits almost immediately. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> With a smart plan, accountability and perseverance, she was able to lose 65# and reach her
            
            desired body weight of 125#. Most importantly, she was in a better frame of mind every day,
            
            likely reduced her risk for disease and illness, and felt motivated to keep the weight off because
            
            she was a much happier person in her new body. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Last I spoke with Marion, she had kept the weight off for three years and was doing well
            
            overall. Marion was definitely a success story  a story that I share with many clients!! </p>
